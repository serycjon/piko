<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­­nager of the new Im­­pe­rial Re­stau­­rant on the Tha­­­mes Em­bankment wen­t
in­­to his lu­­xu­­ri­ous pri­­va­­­te of­­fi­­ce and shut the do­or. Ha­­­ving do­­ne so, he
­­first scratched his chin re­­flecti­­ve­ly, and then to­ok a le­t­­ter from the
dra­­wer in which it had re­­po­­sed for mo­re than two mon­ths and pe­ru­­­sed it
­­ca­­re­­fully. Thou­­­gh he was not aware of it, this was the thi­r­­ti­e­th ti­­me he
had read it sin­­ce bre­ak­­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whi­t
­­nearer un­­der­sta­n­­ding it than he had be­en at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
o­­ver and scru­­­ti­­ni­­zed the ba­c­­k, whe­re not a sign of wri­­ting was to be
­­se­e­­n; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he mi­­ght ho­­pe to dis­­co­­ver
­­so­­me­thing from the wa­­­ter-­­mar­­k; but the­re was no­thing in ei­ther of these
­­pla­­­ces of a na­­tu­­re ca­l­cu­­la­­­ted to set his troubled mind at rest. Then he
­­to­ok a mag­­ni­­fi­­cent re­­pe­a­­­ter watch from his wais­t­­coat po­cket and gla­n­­ced
at the di­a­­l; the hands sto­od at ha­l­­f-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­di­a­­­te­ly threw
the le­t­­ter on the table, and as he did so his anxi­e­­ty found re­­lief in words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­ally the most ex­tra­­or­­di­­na­­­ry af­­fair I ever had to do wi­th,” he
re­­mar­­ked. “And as I’­­ve be­en in the busi­­ness just thre­e-a­n­d-thi­r­­ty year­s
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mon­­day mor­­nin­­g, I ou­­­ght to know so­­me­thing about it.
I on­ly ho­­pe I’­­ve do­­ne righ­t, that’s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­ke­e­per, who had the tre­ble advan­tage of be­in­g
tall, pret­ty, and just ei­gh­t-an­d-twen­ty years of age, en­te­red the ro­om.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the lo­ok upon her chie­f’s fa­ce, and her
cu­ri­o­si­ty was pro­por­ti­o­na­te­ly­ ex­ci­ted.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You se­em worried, Mr. McPher­­son,” she said te­n­­der­ly, as she put dow­­n
the pa­­­pers she had brou­­­ght in for his ­­si­g­­na­­tu­­re.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­­ve just hit it, Miss O’­­Su­l­­li­­va­­­n,” he an­swered, pushing them
­­farther on to the table. “I am worried about ma­­­ny things, bu­­t
­­par­­ticu­­lar­ly about this le­t­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epist­le to her, and she, be­ing de­si­rous of im­pres­sing hi­m
wi­th her busi­ness ca­pa­bi­li­tie­s, read it wi­th os­ten­tati­ous ca­re. But it
was no­ti­ce­a­ble that when she re­a­ched the sig­na­tu­re she too tur­ned bac­k
­to the be­gin­nin­g, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over aga­in. The ma­nager
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the he­ad wai­ter. Ha­vin­g
re­lie­ved his fe­e­lings in this wa­y, he se­a­ted him­self aga­in at his
wri­ting-table, put on his glas­se­s, and sta­red at his com­pa­ni­on, whi­le
wai­ting for her to spe­ak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s ve­­ry fun­­ny­­,” she said. “Ve­­ry fun­­ny­­ in­­de­ed!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most ex­tra­­or­­di­­na­­­ry co­m­­mu­­­ni­­ca­ti­on I ha­­­ve ever re­­ce­i­­ved,” he
replied wi­th con­­victi­on. “Y­­ou see it is wri­t­­ten from Cu­­ya­­ba, Bra­­­zil. The
­­da­­­te is three mon­ths ago to a da­­y. Now I ha­­­ve ta­­­ken the trouble to fin­d
out whe­re and what Cu­­ya­­ba­­ is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­si­on wi­th an air of con­s­ci­ous pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
­so, laid him­self back in his chai­r, stuck his thumbs in­to the ar­mho­le­s
of his waist­coat, and lo­o­ked at his fair subor­di­na­te for ap­pro­val. Nor
was he desti­ned to be di­sap­poin­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in possessi­on of a
s­nug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des be­ing pret­ty, was a la­dy wi­th a ke­en eye
­to the ma­in ­chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­re   <em>is</em>  Cu­ya­ba­?” she asked hum­bly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cu­­ya­­ba­­,” he replied, ro­l­­ling his ton­­gue wi­th con­­si­­de­ra­­ble re­­lish roun­d
his un­­con­s­­ci­ous mispro­­­nun­­ci­a­ti­on of the na­­­me, “is a town al­­most on the
wes­­tern or Bo­­li­­vi­an bor­­der of Bra­­­zil. It is of mo­­de­ra­­­te si­­ze, is
­­si­tu­a­­­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cu­­ya­­ba, and is con­­si­­de­ra­­bly con­­nec­­ted
wi­th the fa­­­mous Bra­­­zi­­li­an Di­a­­­mon­d ­­Fields.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And do­es the wri­­ter of this le­t­­ter li­­ve the­re?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ca­n­­not sa­­y. He wri­­tes from the­re—that is enou­­­gh for us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders din­­ner for four—he­re, in a pri­­va­­­te ro­om over­lo­o­­king the
ri­­ver, three mon­ths ahe­ad—­­punctu­­ally at ei­­ght o’clo­c­­k, gi­­ves you a lis­t
of the things he wan­t­s, and even arra­n­­ges the de­­co­ra­ti­on of the table.
Sa­­ys he has ne­­ver se­en ei­ther of his three fri­ends be­­fo­re; that one of
them hails from (he­re she con­­su­l­­ted the le­t­­ter aga­­in) Ha­n­­g-chow, ano­ther
from Blo­em­­fon­­tein, whi­le the thi­rd re­­si­­de­s, at pre­­se­n­t, in En­­gland. Ea­­ch
o­­ne is to pre­­sent an or­­di­­na­­­ry vi­­si­­ting card wi­th a red dot on it to the
­­por­­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the ro­om at on­­ce. I don’t
un­­der­stand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­nager paused for a mo­men­t, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly­,—”Han­g-chow
is in Chi­na, Blo­em­fon­tein is in Sou­th Af­ri­ca­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a won­­der­­ful man you are, to be su­­re, Mr. McPher­­son! I ne­­ver ca­­­n
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­nage to car­ry so much in your he­ad.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­recti­on,
­for the ma­nager was suscep­ti­ble to her gent­le in­flu­en­ce, as she had
oc­casi­on to k­now.</p> 
 <p>At this junctu­re the he­ad wai­ter ap­pea­red upon the sce­ne, and to­ok up a
­po­si­ti­on just in­si­de the do­orwa­y, as if he were afraid of in­ju­ring the
­car­pet by co­min­g ­farther.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 re­a­­­dy­­, Wi­l­­li­a­m­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­­te re­a­­­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and co­ok tells me he’ll be
re­a­­­dy to dish punctu­­al to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The le­t­­ter sa­­ys, ‘no elect­­ric li­­gh­t; ca­n­dles wi­th red sha­­­des.’ Ha­­­ve you­­
­­put on tho­­se sha­­­des I got this ­­mor­­nin­­g?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just se­en it do­­ne this ve­­ry mi­­nu­­­te, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me se­e, the­re was one other thing.” He to­ok the le­t­­ter from the
chief boo­k­­ke­e­­per’s hand and gla­n­­ced at it. “A­­h, ye­s, a por­­ce­la­­in sau­­­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the ma­n­­tel­­pie­­ce. An ex­tra­­or­­di­­na­­ry­­
request, but has it be­en at­­te­n­­ded ­­to?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­re my­­­sel­­f, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who wai­t?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­ne­s, Ed­­mun­d­s, Bro­oks, an­d ­­To­m­­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­­ry go­­od. Then I think that will do. Sta­­y! You had be­t­­ter tell the
hall por­­ter to lo­ok out for three gent­le­­men pre­­se­n­­ting pla­­in vi­­si­­ting
­­cards wi­th a lit­t­le red spot on them. Let Bro­oks wait in the hall, an­d
when they arri­­ve tell him to show them strai­­ght up to the ro­om.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p>The he­ad wai­ter left the ro­o­m, and the ma­nager stret­ched him­self in his
­chai­r, ya­w­ned by way of showing his im­por­tan­ce, and then sai­d ­so­lemn­ly­,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t be­­lie­­ve they­­’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­­Ni­­ko­la, who­e­ver he may be, won’t be able to find fault wi­th my­­ arra­n­­ge­­ments.”</p> 
 <p>The­n, lea­ving the dus­ty high road of Busi­ness, he and his com­pa­ni­on
wan­de­red in the sha­dy bri­dle-­paths of Lo­ve—­to the end that when the
chief book­ke­e­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to ta­ke pla­ce upstair­s, and was busi­ly­
en­gaged upon a cal­cu­lati­on as to how she would lo­ok in whi­te sa­tin an­d
o­ran­ge blos­som­s, an­d, that sett­led, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
tru­e, as Miss Joy­ce, a subor­di­na­te, had be­en heard to dec­la­re, that the
­ma­nager had on­ce shown him­self par­tial to a cer­ta­in wi­dow wi­th re­pu­ted
sa­vings and a sha­re in an ex­tensi­ve egg and dai­ry­ busi­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to ei­ght pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the ste­ps of the
ho­tel. As so­on as it stop­ped, an un­der­si­zed gentle­ma­n, wi­th a cle­a­n
sha­ven coun­te­nan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­rati­on, and bow le­gs, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal gar­b, ali­gh­ted. He paid and dischar­ged his ca­b­ma­n,
and then to­ok from his ticket po­cket an or­di­na­ry whi­te vi­si­ting car­d,
which he pre­sen­ted to the gol­d-la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
a­pron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spo­t, called a wai­ter, and the
re­ve­rend gentle­man was im­me­di­a­te­ly escor­ted upstairs.</p> 
 <p>Har­dly had the at­ten­dant ti­me to re­turn to his stati­on in the hall,
be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pea­ran­ce, clo­se­ly followed by a thi­rd.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, acti­ve, well-bu­ilt man of about thir­ty­
years of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shi­on, an­d
­to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of hea­vy­
­tex­tu­re. He al­so in his turn han­ded a whi­te card to the por­ter, an­d,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­ce­e­ded in­to the hall, followed by the occu­pant of the
last ca­b, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his exam­ple. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so
in eve­ning dress, but it was of a di­f­fe­rent stamp. It was ol­d-­fa­shi­o­ne­d
and had se­en much use. The wearer, to­o, was taller than the or­di­na­ry run
of me­n, whi­le it was no­ti­ce­a­ble that his hair was snow-whi­te, and that
his fa­ce was de­eply pit­ted wi­th small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of the­ir hat­s
and coats in an an­te-ro­o­m, they re­a­ched ro­om No. 22, whe­re they foun­d
the gentle­man in cle­ri­cal costu­me pa­cing im­pa­ti­ent­ly up an­d ­down.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tallest of the tri­o, who for want of a bet­ter tit­le we
­may call the Best Dres­sed Ma­n, to­ok out his watch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
i­t, lo­o­ked at his com­pa­ni­ons. “Gentle­me­n,” he sai­d, wi­th a sli­gh­t
A­me­ri­can ac­cen­t, “it is three mi­nu­tes to ei­ght o’clock. My na­me is E­as­to­ver!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to hear it, for I’m most un­­co­m­­mon­ly hun­­gry­­,” said the nex­t
tallest, whom I ha­­­ve alre­a­­­dy de­scri­bed as be­ing so mar­­ked by di­­se­a­­­se.
“My na­­­me is ­­Pre­n­­der­­gast!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­ly wait for our fri­end and host,” re­­mar­­ked the cle­ri­­cal gent­le­­ma­­­n,
as if he felt he ou­­­ght to ta­­­ke a sha­­re in the con­­ver­sa­ti­on, and the­­n, as
an af­­terthou­­­gh­t, he con­­ti­­nu­­ed, “My na­­­me is Ba­­x­­ter!”</p> 
 <p>They sho­ok hands all round wi­th mar­ked cor­di­a­li­ty, se­a­ted them­sel­ve­s
a­ga­in, and to­ok it in turns to exa­mi­ne the clock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­­ve you ever had the ple­a­­­su­­re of me­e­­ting our host be­­fo­re?” asked Mr.
Ba­­x­­ter of Mr. ­­Pre­n­­der­­gast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ver,” replied that gent­le­­ma­­­n, wi­th a shake of his he­ad. “Per­ha­­­ps Mr.
E­as­­to­­ver has be­en mo­re ­­for­tu­­­na­­­te?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the brief rejo­in­­der. “I’­­ve had to do wi­th him off and on
­­for lon­­ger than I ca­­re to rec­­kon, but I’­­ve ne­­ver set eyes on him up to ­­da­­­te.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­re may he ha­­­ve be­en the first ti­­me you heard fro­m hi­m?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Na­­shville, Te­n­­nesse­e,” said Eas­­to­­ver. “A­f­­ter that, Ta­­hu­­­pa­­­pa, New
­­Ze­a­­la­n­d; af­­ter that, Pa­­­pe­e­­te, in the So­­ci­e­­ty Is­lan­d­s; then Pekin, Chi­­na­­.
A­n­d y­­ou­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Brus­­sel­s; se­­con­d, Mon­­te Vi­­de­o; thi­r­d, Ma­n­­da­­la­­y, and the­­n
the Gold Co­ast, Af­ri­­ca. It’s your tur­­n, Mr. Ba­­x­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was exact­ly ei­ght o’clock.
“­First ti­me, Ca­bu­l, Af­gha­nista­n; se­con­d, Nij­ni No­v­go­rod, Rus­si­a; thi­r­d,
Wil­can­ni­a, Dar­ling Ri­ver, Aus­tra­li­a; fourth, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fifth,
­Na­ga­sa­ki, Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­den­t­ly a gre­at tra­­­veller and a most mys­­te­ri­ous ­­per­­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­re than that,” said Eas­­to­­ver wi­th con­­victi­on; “he is la­­­te for ­­din­­ner!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­gast lo­o­ked at his watch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­­nu­­­tes fast. Har­­k, the­re go­­es Big Be­­n! Ei­­gh­t exact­ly­­.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the do­or was thrown open and a voice an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Ni­ko­la­.”</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to the­ir fe­et si­mul­ta­ne­ously, wi­th exc­la­mati­ons of
as­to­nishmen­t, as the man they had be­en dis­cus­sing ma­de his ap­pea­ran­ce.</p> 
 <p>It would ta­ke mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
a­dequa­te and inclusi­ve de­scrip­ti­on of the per­son who en­te­red the ro­om at
that mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was sli­ght­ly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, his
shoul­ders were broad, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and pla­in­ly muscu­lar,
but ve­ry slim. His he­ad, which was mag­ni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­der­s,
was ador­ned wi­th a pro­fusi­on of glossy black hai­r; his fa­ce was
­desti­tu­te of beard or mousta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me
­moul­din­g; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hu­e, a co­lour whi­ch
har­mo­ni­zed well wi­th his pier­cing black eyes and pear­ly te­eth. His hand­s
and fe­et were small, and the gre­a­test dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
was irre­pro­a­chably dres­sed, wi­th a ne­at­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he mi­ght ha­ve be­en any­thing from ei­gh­t-an­d-twen­ty to
­for­ty; in re­a­li­ty he was thir­ty­-three. He advan­ced in­to the ro­om an­d
wal­ked wi­th ou­t-stret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to whe­re Eas­to­ver was
stan­ding by the ­fi­repla­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Eas­­to­­ver, I fe­el cer­ta­­in,” he sai­d, fi­xing his gli­t­­te­ring eyes upon
the man he ad­d­re­s­­sed, and allowing a cu­­ri­ous smi­le to play upon his ­­fa­­­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­­me, Dr. Ni­­ko­la­­,” the other an­swered wi­th evi­­dent sur­­pri­­se.
“But how on earth can you dis­­tingu­­ish me from your other ­­gu­­est­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would sur­­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pre­n­­der­­gast, and Mr.
Ba­­x­­ter. This is de­­li­­gh­t­­fu­­l; I ho­­pe I am not la­­­te. We had a co­l­­li­­si­on in
the Cha­n­­nel this mor­­nin­­g, and I was al­­most afraid I mi­­ght not be up to
­­ti­­me. Din­­ner se­ems re­a­­­dy; shall we sit down to it?” They se­a­­­ted
them­­sel­­ve­s, and the me­al co­m­­me­n­­ced. The Im­­pe­rial Re­stau­­rant has ear­­ne­d
an en­­vi­a­­ble re­­pu­­ta­ti­on for do­ing things well, and the din­­ner that ni­­gh­t
­­did not in any way de­tract from its lustre. Bu­­t, de­­li­­gh­t­­ful as it all
was, it was no­­ti­­ce­a­­ble that the three gu­­ests paid mo­re at­­te­n­­ti­on to
the­ir host than to his ex­­cellent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re his
arri­va­l, they had all had de­a­lings wi­th him for se­ve­ral year­s, but what
tho­se de­a­lings were they were ca­re­ful not to de­scri­be. It was mo­re tha­n
­possi­ble that they har­dly li­ked to re­mem­ber them them­sel­ves.</p> 
 <p>When co­f­fee had be­en ser­ved and the servants had wi­thdra­w­n, Dr. Ni­ko­la­
ro­se from the table, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­bo­ard. On it
s­to­od a bas­ket of ve­ry cu­ri­ous sha­pe and workman­ship. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the as­t­o­nishment of his gu­est­s, an enor­mous cat, as
black as his mas­ter’s coat, le­a­ped out on to the flo­or. The re­a­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Se­a­ting him­self at the table aga­in, the host followed the exam­ple of his
­gu­ests and lit a ci­gar, blowing a cloud of smoke lu­xu­ri­ous­ly throu­gh his
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­selled nos­trils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
the ro­o­m, to­ok in the pictu­res and de­co­rati­on­s, and then ca­me down to
­me­et the fa­ces of his com­pa­ni­ons. As they did so, the black cat, ha­vin­g
­fi­nished its me­a­l, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, watchin­g
the three men throu­gh the cur­ling smoke drift wi­th its gre­en blin­kin­g,
­fi­en­dish eyes. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
upon his ­gu­ests.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to busi­­ness?” he sai­d brisk­ly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly knocked the ashes off the­ir ci­gars an­d
brou­ght them­sel­ves to at­ten­ti­on. Dr. Ni­ko­la­’s da­in­ty, lan­gu­id man­ner
­se­e­med to drop from him li­ke a clo­ak, his eyes brigh­te­ne­d, and his
­voice, when he spo­ke, was cle­an cut as chi­selled ­sil­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are doub­t­less anxi­ous to be in­­for­­med why I sum­­mo­­ned you from all
­­parts of the glo­be to me­et me he­re to-­­ni­­gh­t? And it is ve­­ry na­­tu­­ral you­­
should be. But the­­n, from what you know of me, you should not be
­­sur­­pri­­sed at any­­thing I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p>His voice drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gent­le lan­gu­or. He drew in a
­gre­at bre­ath of smoke and then sent it slowly out from his lips aga­in.
His eyes were half clo­sed, and he drum­med wi­th one fin­ger on the table
ed­ge. The cat lo­o­ked throu­gh the smoke at the three me­n, and it se­e­med
­to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fe­ro­ci­ous. Pre­sent­ly­
his ow­ner to­ok him from his per­ch, and se­a­ting him on his knee fell to
stro­king his fur, from he­ad to tai­l, wi­th his long slim fin­gers. It was
as if he were dra­wing in­spi­rati­on for so­me de­adly mischief from the
un­can­ny­ be­ast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­fa­­­ce what I ha­­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by­­
­­far the most im­­por­tant busi­­ness for which I ha­­­ve ever requi­red your
help. (Three slow stro­­kes down the ce­n­t­re of the ba­c­­k, and one roun­d
e­ach ear.) When it first ca­­­me in­­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the mat­­ter. I thou­­­ght of Ve­n­­don, but I found Ve­n­­don was de­ad. I
thou­­­ght of Brow­n­low, but Brow­n­low was no lon­­ger fai­th­­ful. (Two stro­­ke­s
­­down the back and two on the thro­at.) Then bit by bit I re­­mem­be­red you­­.
I was in Bra­­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­­me. So far so ­­go­­od.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­repla­ce. As he went the cat crawled
back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­ti­on on his shoul­der. Then his voice chan­ged
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer busi­ness-­li­ke ­to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not go­­ing to tell you ve­­ry much about it. But from what I do tell
y­­ou, you will be able to gather a gre­at de­al and ima­­­gi­­ne the rest. To
be­­gin wi­th, the­re is a man li­­ving in this world to-­­day who has do­­ne me a
­­gre­at and las­­ting in­ju­­­ry. What that in­ju­­­ry is is no con­­cern of yours.
Y­­ou would not un­­der­stand if I told you. So we’ll le­a­­­ve that out of the
que­s­­ti­on. He is im­­me­n­­se­ly rich. His cheque for £300,000 would be
ho­­nou­­red by his bank at any mi­­nu­­­te. Ob­­vi­ous­ly he is a power. He has had
re­a­­­son to know that I am pi­t­­ting my wits aga­­inst his, and he flat­­ter­s
hi­m­­self that so far he has got the be­t­­ter of me. That is be­­cause I am
dra­­wing him on. I am ma­­tu­­ring a plan which will ma­­­ke him a po­or and a
­­ve­­ry mi­­se­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me su­c­­ce­ed­s,
and I am sa­­­tis­­fied wi­th the way you three men ha­­­ve per­­for­­med the parts I
shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it do­e­s­­n’t su­c­­ce­ed, then you will each re­­ce­i­­ve a thou­­sa­n­d
and your ex­­pe­n­­se­s. Do you follow ­­me?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from the­ir fa­ces that they hung upon his eve­ry­ word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Bu­­t, re­­mem­ber, I de­­mand from you your who­le and en­­ti­re la­­­bour. Whi­le
y­­ou are ser­­ving me you are mi­­ne bo­­dy and soul. I know you are
trustworthy. I ha­­­ve had go­­od pro­­of that you are—­­par­­don the
ex­­pre­s­­si­on—un­scru­­­pu­­lous, and I flat­­ter my­­­self you are si­lent. What is
­­mo­re, I shall tell you no­thing bey­­ond what is ne­­cessa­­­ry for the carry­­in­­g
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
my­­ ­­pla­n­s!”</p> 
 <p>He sat down aga­in and to­ok a pa­per from his po­cket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to E­as­to­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will le­a­­­ve at on­­ce—that is to sa­­y, by the bo­at on Wed­­ne­sda­­y­­—­­for
Sy­d­­ney. You will book your passage to-­­morrow mor­­nin­­g, first thin­­g, an­d
jo­in her in Ply­mou­­th. You will me­et me to-­­morrow eve­­ning at an ad­d­ress I
will send you, and re­­ce­i­­ve your fi­­nal in­structi­ons. ­­Go­­od-­­ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p>Se­e­ing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, sho­ok hand­s, and left
the ro­om wi­thout a word. He was too as­t­o­nished to he­si­ta­te or to sa­y­ a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la to­ok ano­ther let­ter from his po­cket and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to-­ni­gh­t, cross to Pa­ris to-­morrow mor­nin­g,
and lea­ve this let­ter per­so­nally at the ad­d­ress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thur­sda­y, at hal­f-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
an­swer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find su­f­fi­ci­ent mo­ney in
that en­ve­lo­pe to pay all your ex­pen­se­s. Now ­go­!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At ha­l­­f-­­past two you shall ha­­­ve your an­swer. ­­Go­­od-­­ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­­od-­­ni­­ght.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the ro­o­m, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar an­d
tur­ned his at­ten­ti­ons to Mr. Ba­x­ter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six mon­ths ago, Mr. Ba­­x­­ter, I found for you a si­tua­ti­on as tu­­­tor to the
y­­oung Marquis of Bec­­ke­­nham. You still hold it, I ­­sup­­po­­se?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the father well dis­­po­­sed to­­war­d­s y­­ou­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­­ry wa­­y. I ha­­­ve do­­ne my best to in­­gra­­­ti­a­­­te my­­­self wi­th him. That
was one of your in­structi­ons.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ye­s, ye­s! But I was not cer­ta­­in that you would su­c­­ce­ed. If the old ma­­­n
is any­­thing li­­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
­­di­­f­­ficult per­­son to de­al wi­th. Do­es the boy li­­ke y­­ou­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­­pe ­­so.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­­ve you brou­­­ght me his pho­­to­­gra­­­ph as I ­­di­rec­­ted?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­­ve. He­re it is.”</p> 
 <p>Ba­x­ter to­ok a pho­to­gra­ph from his po­cket and han­ded it across the table.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Go­­od. You ha­­­ve do­­ne ve­­ry well, Mr. Ba­­x­­ter. I am ple­a­­­sed wi­th you­­.
­­To-­­morrow mor­­ning you will go back to Y­­orkshire——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your par­­don, Bour­­ne­mou­­th. His Gra­­­ce owns a hou­­­se near
­­Bour­­ne­mou­­th, which he occu­­­pies du­­ring the sum­­mer ­­mon­ths.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­­ry well—then to-­­morrow mor­­ning you will go back to Bour­­ne­mou­­th an­d
­­con­­ti­­nue to in­­gra­­­ti­a­­­te your­­self wi­th father and son. You will al­­so be­­gin
­­to im­­plant in the boy­­’s mind a de­­si­re for tra­­­vel. Don’t let him be­­co­­me
a­­­ware that his de­­si­re has its sour­­ce in you­­—but do not fail to fos­­ter
it all you can. I will co­m­­mu­­­ni­­ca­­­te wi­th you further in a day or two. Now ­­go­­.”</p> 
 <p>Ba­x­ter in his turn left the ro­om. The do­or clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pic­ked up
the pho­to­gra­ph and stu­died it.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­­ke­­ness is un­­mis­takable—or it ou­­­ght to be. My fri­e­n­d, my ve­ry­­
­­dear fri­e­n­d, Wethe­rell, my to­ils are clo­­sing on you. My arra­n­­ge­­ments are
­­per­­fecting them­­sel­­ves ad­­mi­ra­­bly. Pre­­sen­t­ly, when all is co­m­­ple­­te, I
shall press the le­­ver, the ma­­chi­­ne­­ry will be set in mo­­ti­on, and you will
­­find your­­self be­ing slowly but su­­re­ly ground in­­to pow­­der. Then you will
hand over what I wa­n­t, and be sor­­ry you thou­­­ght fit to baulk Dr. ­­Ni­­ko­la­­!”</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty dischar­ged, he pla­ced
the cat back in its pri­son, shut the li­d, descen­ded wi­th the bas­ket to
the hall, and called a han­som. The por­ter inqui­red to what ad­d­ress he
should or­der the ca­b­man to dri­ve. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not reply for a mo­men­t,
then he sai­d, as if he had be­en thin­king so­me­thing ou­t: “The  <em>Gre­e­n
Sai­lor</em>  pu­b­lic-hou­se, East In­dia Doc­k Road.”</p>
